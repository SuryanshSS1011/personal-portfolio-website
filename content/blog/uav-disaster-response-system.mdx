# Autonomous UAVs for Disaster Response: A Multidisciplinary Approach

Natural disasters require rapid response capabilities that traditional methods often cannot provide. Our UAV-based disaster management research explores how autonomous drone systems can revolutionize emergency response operations.

The technical foundation combines LiDAR sensor integration for 3D environmental mapping with SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithms that enable navigation in GPS-denied environments - a critical capability in disaster zones where infrastructure may be compromised.

Machine learning plays a crucial role in automated debris detection and path planning. Our algorithms can identify potential survivors, assess structural damage, and optimize flight paths for maximum coverage while minimizing battery consumption.

The real-world validation process involved collaboration with emergency management professionals, ensuring that our technical solutions address actual operational needs. This multidisciplinary approach has been essential for developing practical, deployable systems.

Key applications include search and rescue operations, rapid damage assessment, supply delivery to inaccessible areas, and providing real-time situational awareness to first responders. The system's modular design allows for rapid deployment across different disaster scenarios.

While still in the research phase, this project demonstrates the potential for autonomous systems to save lives and improve disaster response effectiveness when human responders face dangerous or inaccessible conditions.
